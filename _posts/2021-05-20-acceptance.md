It was on May 17, the day GSoC results were announced and I am happy to share that my [proposal][proposal] to CCExtractor Developement has been accepted.

Back when I faced problems while setting up the environment to the stage where I currently got accepted into GSoC, it has been quite a long journey. I would like to thank [Willem][Willem]: https://github.com/canihavesomecoffee and [Shivam][Shivam]: https://github.com/canihavesomecoffee for guiding me in my proposal and also in helping me solve issues. I am really exicited to work with this amazing organization.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
