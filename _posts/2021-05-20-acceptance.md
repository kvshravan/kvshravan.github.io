It was on May 17, the day GSoC results were announced and I am happy to share that my [proposal][proposal] with CCExtractor Developement has been accepted.

Back when I faced problems while setting up the environment to the stage where I currently got accepted into GSoC, it has been a long journey. I would like to thank [Willem][Willem] and [Shivam][Shivam] for guiding me in this journey and I am really exicited to work for such an amazing organization.

This summer I'll be working on my project, [Migrating sample platform from KVM to Google Cloud](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fLRCzR_v6CBweDH6GSe45DOpmNlhx4VC/view?usp=sharing), under the mentorship of [Willem][Willem] and [Shivam][Shivam]. Looking forward for a great summer ahead.
